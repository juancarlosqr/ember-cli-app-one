Ember CLI installation issues
-----------------------------
when installing ember-cli and running 'ember server' throw next error:

> ember server

Could not find watchman, falling back to NodeWatcher for file system events.
Visit http://www.ember-cli.com/#watchman for more info.

after this, i installed watchman:

after running server again:
> ember server

Error: A non-recoverable condition has triggered.  Watchman needs your help!
The triggering condition was at timestamp=1435519626: inotify-add-watch(/home/juancarlosqr/code/ember-cli-app-one) -> The user limit on the total number of inotify watches was reached; increase the fs.inotify.max_user_watches sysctl

the original value was:

8192

after changing this value to 10000, gives no error:
